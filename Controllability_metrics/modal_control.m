function [values] = modal_control(A)
% FUNCTION:
%         Returns values of MODAL CONTROLLABILITY for each node in a
%         network, given the adjacency matrix for that network. Modal
%         controllability indicates the ability of that node to steer the
%         system into difficult-to-reach states, given input at that node.
%
% INPUT:
%         A is the structural (NOT FUNCTIONAL) network adjacency matrix, 
% 	      such that the simple linear model of dynamics outlined in the 
% 	      reference is an accurate estimate of brain state fluctuations. 
% 	      Assumes all values in the matrix are positive, and that the 
% 	      matrix is symmetric.
%
% OUTPUT:
%         Vector of modal controllability values for each node
